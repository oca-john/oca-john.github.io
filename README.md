# ðŸŽ“ Academic / Xi Zhang

This is my academic homepage.

Despite the widespread adoption of deep learning facilitated by general models, I remain firmly convinced that highly specialized models are irreplaceable in the realm of expertise. Drawing inspiration from biological knowledge and employing computational techniques, I strive for an effective integration of these disciplines in my research endeavors. Currently, my research focus resides in feature representation and feature fusion of time-series data, with the ultimate objective of developing robust analysis and prediction models for such signals.
